<h1>Cards<br>Against<br>Humanity</h1>
<h2>Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. </h2>
<hr>
<h3>
  Unlike most of the party games you've played before, Cards Against Humanity is as despicable and awkward as you and your friends.<br>
  And now you can play it online with strangers too!<br>
  <br><br>The game is simple. <br>Each round, computer asks a question from a black card, and everyone answers with their funniest white card.
